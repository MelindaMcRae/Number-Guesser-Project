# Number Guesser
## General Info
This is a project for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.

** Description
Number Guesser is a project that was assigned to students at Turing. We were given static comps that outlined the expected styling details of both desktop and mobile versions of our project. Those comps were then reproduced from scratch. The expected functionality of the projects were included as well (when buttons need to be activated/deactivated, producing a random number between the entered range, etc.). This was made by working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Media queries were used to make the design responsive in different window sizes.

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
